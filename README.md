# Finance Portfolio Engineering using Python

- Implemented advanced time series analysis techniques, including Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) and Relative Strength Index (RSI), to identify market trends and generate trading signals.
- Utilized the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to calculate expected returns and assess the risk-return tradeoff of individual assets.
- Implemented a custom backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of various trading strategies across different market conditions


# Key Objectives
- Implement Moving Average Crossover and Bollinger Bands strategies
- Optimize portfolio performance using Mean-Variance Optimization
- Achieve a Sharpe ratio greater than 1.0
- Analyze strategy performance across different asset classes
- Compare portfolio performance to individual strategies and benchmarks


# Data Analysis
Analyzed historical price data for multiple financial instruments, focusing on:

- Calculating moving averages and Bollinger Bands
- Implementing Go Flat and Go Short variations of Moving Average Crossover
- Evaluating strategy performance using Sharpe ratios
- Conducting Mean-Variance Optimization for portfolio construction
